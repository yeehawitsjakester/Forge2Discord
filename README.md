<!> This mod has been modified to fit certain needs and wants with a local friend group server I use at Apex Hosting. It's also being used somewhat as a start to learning Java. Expect some bad code and no optimizations! ~Jakester


This mod combines your Discord with your Minecraft server.

This is a server-side mod and therefore don't need to be on the client.

#### Changes compared to previous versions
- Support for multiple Discord channels
- Ability to configure per Discord channel and per Minecraft dimension
- All commands is executed through a FakeUser [(DiscordFakeUser / 828653ca-0185-43d4-b26d-620a7f016be6)](https://mcuuid.net/?q=828653ca-0185-43d4-b26d-620a7f016be6) that you can decide permissions to through vanilla OP and other permission mods.
